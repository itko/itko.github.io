# Glass Ceiling

Examining gender gaps in the workplace is notoriously difficult, in large part because of lack of reliable data. But there might be a way to get around that. Every year, the Canadian province of Ontario releases a list of all public employees who earn than $100,000 per year. Normally, this dataset is not enough to investigate differences in salary between men and women. But if we combine this with a dataset of the most common male and female names in Canada, then we can assign each person in the Ontario dataset a gender.

## Salary Differences
Do women earn less than men? That's the question that comes to everyone's mind when thinking about gender discrimination. After adjusting for the number of years of experience (and for purchasing power over time), we find that the  difference in salaries between men and women is not meaningful.

## Boy's Club
Pure salary is not the full story. Even if women seemingly earn as much as men, the composition of men and women is not consistent. Namely, the more years of experience a worker has, the more likely they are to be a man. In fact, at 10+ years of experience, women account for less than 20% of workers. This may be due to women taking on domestic duties as mothers and wives.

## Limitations
This analysis is still in very early phases, and there are still many things to consider and account for.
1. All the salaries we examine here are for workers in the public sector. The gender dynamics could be completely different in the private sector.
1. This analysis just scratches the surface of the issue. I'm sure a sociologist or socioeconomist would have a lot more to say in the matter.

## Conclusion
In one sentence: men and women with similar experience earn similar salaries, however women tend to have less experience than men. More analysis coming soon!
