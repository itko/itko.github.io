# Americana

People from different states have different cultures, habits, and interests. For example, people from New Jersey and New York show more interest in Seinfeld than people from Minnesota. These interests manifest themselves in Google Search behaviour: New Yorkers search "Seinfeld" more than Minnesotans. By analyzing this search behaviour (via Google Trends), we can describe the relationships between different states.

## Similar States
We can expand our analysis of search behaviour to many more topics. For example, New Yorkers and New Jersyites are not just similar in their interest in Seinfeld, they are also similar in their interest in League of Legends.  By examining interests in dozens of such topics, we can understand which states are most similar to each other.

## Getting Weird
Along the same lines, we can find the "wierdest" state. This is a loaded word; really, we're just ranking the states based on how different they are from other states.
