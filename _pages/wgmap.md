# WGmap

Basically all young people in Zurich (and most of Switzerland) uses the same website to find rooms and apartments. But for some odd reason, the UI/UX is [atrocious](https://www.wgzimmer.ch/en/wgzimmer/search/mate.html). Think of it as Craigslist, only stuffed with ads all over the place.

In an effort to improve the experience, I created a free platform where people can explore all the listings on a simple, clutter-free map. See here for the live version: [wgmap.co](https://wgmap.co/)
