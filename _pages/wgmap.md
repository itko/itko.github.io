# WGmap

When it comes to renting apartments and rooms in Switzerland, one website rules them all. But their website is badly designed to the point of [being unusable](https://www.wgzimmer.ch/en/wgzimmer/search/mate.html).

In an effort to improve the experience, I created WGmap: a free platform where people can explore all the listings on a [simple, clutter-free map](https://wgmap.co/). It's a barebones app, but it has already become one of the largest rental databases in Switzerland.
